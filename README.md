# GfG-160-Days-Challenge



Welcome to my **GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of Code Challenge** repository! 🎯
This repo is a collection of my daily solutions to coding problems aimed at strengthening my grasp on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).**

## 📌 About the Challenge

The **GFG 160 Days Challenge** is a structured program focused on enhancing DSA problem-solving skills. Over the course of 160 days, it covers a wide range of core computer science topics including:

* ✅ Arrays
* ✅ Strings
* ✅ Recursion
* ✅ Dynamic Programming
* ✅ Graphs
* ✅ Trees
* ✅ Bit Manipulation
* ✅ And many more...

---

## 🛠 Repository Structure

Each day’s solution is neatly organized into folders by day:

```
📁 Day_01/   # Solution for Day 1  
📁 Day_02/   # Solution for Day 2  
...  
📁 Day_160/  # Final day’s solution
```

Each folder typically includes:

* ✅ Solution file (`.java`)
* ✅ Problem statement (`README.md`)
* ✅ Explanation or approach (if needed)
