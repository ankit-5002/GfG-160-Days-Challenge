# GfG-160-Days-Challenge


Welcome to my GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of Code Challenge repository! 🎯
This repo is a collection of my daily solutions to coding problems aimed at strengthening my grasp on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

📌 About the Challenge
The GFG 160 Days Challenge is a structured program focused on enhancing DSA problem-solving skills. Over the course of 160 days, it covers a wide range of core computer science topics including:

✅ Arrays

✅ Strings

✅ Recursion

✅ Dynamic Programming

✅ Graphs

✅ Trees

✅ Bit Manipulation

✅ And many more...

🛠 Repository Structure
Each day’s solution is neatly organized into folders by day:

📁 Day_01/     # Solution for Day 1  
📁 Day_02/     # Solution for Day 2  
📁 ...  
📁 Day_160/    # Final day’s solution  

Every folder typically contains:

✅ Solution file (.java)

✅ Problem statement (README.md)

✅ Explanation or approach (if needed)

🚧 Progress Tracker
