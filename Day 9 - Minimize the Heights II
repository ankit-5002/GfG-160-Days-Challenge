### Minimize the Heights II 

Given an array arr[] denoting heights of n towers and a positive integer k.
For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.
Increase the height of the tower by k
Decrease the height of the tower by k
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.
You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by k for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.



class Solution {
    int getMinDiff(int[] arr, int k) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.length;
        
        Arrays.sort(arr);
       
       int diff = arr[n-1] - arr[0];
       
       for (int i=1; i<n; i++){
           
        if(arr[i] - k < 0)
            continue;
       
        int min = Math.min(arr[0]+k, arr[i] - k);
       
        int max = Math.max(arr[i-1]+k, arr[n-1]-k);
       
        diff = Math.min(diff, max-min);
       
       }
       
       return diff;
       
       
    }
}
